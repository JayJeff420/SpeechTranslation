##  Features

 Translate **spoken input** (via microphone) into any supported language  
 Translate **typed text** directly from the command line  
 Auto-adjusts for background noise during recording  
 Supports **over 100 languages** through Google Translate  
 Clean, modular code with both synchronous and asynchronous handling
